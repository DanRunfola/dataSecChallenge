# Creating your account

In order to use the high performance computing environments at William & Mary, you must first request access for your W&M user ID.  This process can be completed by following the instructions at https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/acctreq/index.php .  Note the process is not automated, and thus it can take a few days before your new account permissions are enabled.

Of note, if you work in a specific research lab on campus (i.e., [geoLab](geolab.wm.edu)), it is important to note that in your account signup, as that will allow the HPC team to give your account appropriate permissions for both files and computational resources.
