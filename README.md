# Welcome to the **geoLab Twitter Dis/Misinformation & Machine Learning Competition!**
The geoLab/CCI twitter dis/misinformation competition is part of an *experiential learning* project designed to give participants real-world experience in data security.  We're focused on exploring how treating dis/misinformation as data poisoning could potentially help us identify intentionally misleading tweets this year.

This year we'll be hosting a three-phase contest.  In phase 1, you'll be provided with a dataset of known tweets tagged as either being from credible sources, or sources known to spread dis/misinformation.  Students will work to build the best deep learning model they can to disambiguate these cases, and will have access to prebuilt examples, a full tutorial, a live website they can submit their results to, and regular weekly office hours. 

In the next two phases, we will be designing a second model on the basis of manually-identified mis/disinformation examples from Russian sources.  Led by Dr. Anthony Stefanidis, this will be an opportunity to work on a research paper that explores the capability of machine learning to identify such cases.  You will be working closely with us to both collect data (**Phase 2**) and produce models (**Phase 3**).  At the end of April, we'll hold a second round of competition based on the labeled dataset you produce.
