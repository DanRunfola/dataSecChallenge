# ðŸ‘· Jobs

A job is basically a resource check-out. When we launch a job, we tell the computer a couple basic things:

1. Which sub-cluster you would like to run on
2. How many nodes and processors you would like to check out
3. How long you want your resources for (i.e. the maximum amount of time you expect your program to take to run) - this is called the _walltime_
4. The name of your job

You can run either non-interactive or interactive jobs.
